# Easy and Simple Game Library
ESGL is, as the name describes, an Easy and Simple Game Library made for JVM languages.
It is written in Kotlin and uses Raylib-Java under the hood.

This repository contains ESGL in package `com.itaypoo.esgl`, and an example game in package `com.itaypoo.exampleGame`.

This is a passion project made for fun, not meant to be taken too seriously.
